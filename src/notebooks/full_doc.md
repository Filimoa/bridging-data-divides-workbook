Oregon Voluntary Cleanup Sites <br>This summary contains the findings and opinions of the environmental site assessment (ESA) and is 
intended for use with the supporting text, figures, and attachments of the complete report. <br><br>At the request of City of St. Helens, Maul Foster & Alongi, Inc. (MFA) conducted this Phase I ESA 
of the site at 400 South 1st Street, St. Helens, Oregon (the Property). <br><br>This Phase I ESA was conducted in accordance with the requirements of the American Society for 
Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Practice for Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I 
Environmental Site Assessment Process (ASTM E1527-13). The Phase I ESA also was prepared to 
support the Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser defense (Comprehensive Environmental Response, 
Compensation and Liability Act [CERCLA] § 101(4)) and the innocent purchaser defense (CERCLA 
§ 101(35)(A)(i)). This Phase I ESA generally complies with 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 312, 
adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on November 5, 2005, and effective 
November 1, 2006. These rules identify the standards and practices for all appropriate inquiries 
under CERCLA § 101(35)(B). The purpose of the Phase I ESA was to identify, to the extent 
reasonably feasible, “recognized environmental conditions” (RECs). <br>PROPERTY SUMMARY <br><br>Historical maps show that a sawmill occupied the Property in 1911, but it has been noted that 
sawmills may have operated on the Property as early as the mid-1800s1. Boise Cascade Wood 
Products LLC purchased the property in 1971 and subsequently converted the warehouse and 
planer mill in the southern portion of the property into a veneer mill. The sawmill was closed in 
1978 and was intentionally demolished through a controlled burn in 1985. Wood treating (anti-
sapstain) is not known to have been conducted on the Property. <br><br>A conditional No Further Action (NFA) determination from the Oregon Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ) for petroleum hydrocarbons in soil beneath the lathe mill area was 
issued in 2004 under the condition that if this area was exposed in the future it would be fully 
evaluated at that time. The veneer mill remained in operation until 2009. Equipment was removed 
from the veneer mill in 2012, and the building was demolished in 2013. In anticipation of selling the 
property for potential future development, Boise Cascade was obligated to further evaluate the Site 
that included the lathe area in anticipation of the concrete cap being removed. Boise Cascade also 
investigated other areas with known or suspected release including the former oil house and 
transformer area and debarker area. After completion of a remedial investigation and selected 
removal actions, DEQ issued a conditional NFA determination for the Property on June 8, 2015. It 
is expected that this determination will be followed by a Prospective Purchaser Agreement (PPA) 
and Consent Judgment between the State of Oregon and the City. <br>RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS <br><br>ASTM E1527-13 defines RECs as the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or 
petroleum products in, on, or at a property: (1) due to any release to the environment; (2) under 
conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or (3) under conditions that pose a material 
threat of a future release to the environment. <br><br>No uncontrolled RECs were identified for the Property. <br><br>CONTROLLED RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS <br><br>ASTM E1527-13 defines controlled RECs (CRECs) as resulting from a past release of hazardous 
substances or petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable 
regulatory authority. <br><br>The CRECs identified through completion of this Phase I ESA are noted below and are discussed in 
further detail throughout this report. Figure ES-1 displays the area names used to describe different 
portions of the Property. <br><br>• Groundwater concentration in excess of the DEQ residential, urban residential, and 
occupational risk-based concentrations (RBCs) for lead, arsenic, polycyclic aromatic 
hydrocarbons (PAHs), diesel-range organics (DRO), and residual-range organics (RRO) 
have been observed on portions of the Property. In addition, benzo(a)pyrene (a PAH) 
was observed in groundwater in excess of the DEQ excavation worker RBC in two 
locations on the southeastern portion of the Property (one in Riverside and one in the 
Barker Area). <br><br>• PAHs in shallow soil above the DEQ residential, urban residential, and occupational <br><br>RBCs in the Lumber Mill Area. <br>• DRO and RRO impacts to shallow and deep soil above DEQ residential, urban 
residential, occupational, and construction worker RBCs were observed in the Lathe 
Area. <br><br>• Lead-impacted soil remains along a portion of the northwestern periphery of the <br><br>Property. <br><br>• <br><br>It is recognized that, because of the known presence of fill material and long operational 
history of the Property, that additional areas that have not been identified may contain 
impacted soil and/or groundwater. For example, sampling of soils at depths less than 3 
feet below ground surface is limited. There are also a number of instances where soils at 
depth would exceed residential, urban residential, occupational, and/or construction 
worker RBCs if brought to the surface (i.e., the Lathe Area, the Oil House and 
Transformer Area, the Barker Area, and Riverside). <br><br>On June 8, 2015, the DEQ issued a conditional NFA determination for the Property. To ensure 
protectiveness, the conditions detailed in the NFA outline the control of environmental conditions <br><br>R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br>on the Property and were developed in consideration of future redevelopment for a variety of uses, 
including residential. All of the above-noted CRECs are controlled through the conditions outlined 
in the DEQ NFA determination, including the following: <br><br>1. Extraction of groundwater through wells or by other means for use at the Property for <br><br>consumption or other beneficial use is prohibited. <br><br>2. An impermeable cap will be maintained in the lathe area to prevent potential future exposure 
by site workers or residents and to minimize future leaching of contamination into shallow 
groundwater. <br><br>3. Any contaminated soil or groundwater removed from the site must be managed in 
accordance with a DEQ-approved contaminated-media management plan (CMMP). 
Residual soil in the northern removal area, lathe area, and localized area around TP-13 
(located in the Sawmill Area of the Property), and groundwater near B-18 and B-20 (located 
in the Riverside and Barker Areas, respectively), will be identified in the CMMP as specific 
areas of concern. These restrictions and requirements should be memorialized in an 
Easement and Equitable Servitudes recorded on the Property deed. <br><br>HISTORICAL RECOGNIZED ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS <br>ASTM E1527-13 defines historical RECs (HRECs) as a past release of any hazardous substances or 
petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the Property and that has been addressed 
to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, or meets unrestricted use criteria established 
by a regulatory authority, without the Property being subjected to any required controls. <br><br>One HREC was identified for the Property as follows: <br><br>A former maintenance building on the northwestern corner of the Property was demolished in the 
mid-1990s, and petroleum-impacted soil was observed under the concrete floor. Approximately 
400 tons of soil was excavated and disposed of at an off-site facility. Post-excavation confirmation 
soil sampling depicts low concentrations of volatile organic compounds and PAHs. Additional soil 
sampling was conducted in 2002/2003, with detections of PAHs below all applicable human health 
RBCs. <br><br>DE MINIMIS CONDITIONS <br><br>A de minimis condition, as defined by ASTM E1527-13, is a condition that generally does not 
present a threat to human health or the environment and that generally would not be the subject of 
an enforcement action if brought to the attention of appropriate governmental agencies. <br>ADDITIONAL FINDINGS <br><br>A state-led sediment investigation is being conducted along the Multnomah Channel (adjacent to the 
Property) and the Scappoose Slough. A number of the investigations discussed throughout this 
report have focused on assessing the Property’s potential to be a contributing upland source area. 
These investigations have documented current conditions, and many include work plans accepted by 
DEQ. As with any ongoing investigation, there remains the potential for the Property to be 
identified as a contributing upland source area in the future, either under observance of additional 
data and/or because of changing conditions. However, based on current conditions, the DEQ has 
concluded that the Property is protective of public health and the environment and has issued an 
NFA and is in the process of entering into a Prospective Purchaser Agreement with the City. <br><br>DATA GAPS <br><br>No significant data gaps were identified. <br><br>CONCLUSIONS <br><br>MFA has conducted a Phase I ESA, in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM 
Practice E1527-13, of 400 South 1st Street, St. Helens, Oregon. <br><br>The Phase I ESA revealed evidence of CRECs and an HREC in connection with the Property. <br>On behalf of City of St. Helens, Maul Foster & Alongi, Inc. (MFA) conducted a Phase I 
environmental site assessment (ESA) of the property located at 400 South 1st Street, St. Helens, 
Oregon (the Property) (see Figure 1). The Phase I ESA was conducted in accordance with the 
requirements of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Standard Practice for 
Environmental Site Assessments: Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Process (ASTM E1527-
13). The Phase I ESA also was prepared to support the Bona Fide Prospective Purchaser defense 
(Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act [CERCLA] § 101(4)) 
and the innocent purchaser defense (CERCLA § 101(35)(A)(i)). This Phase I ESA generally 
complies with 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 312, adopted by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency (USEPA) on November 5, 2005, and effective November 1, 2006. These rules 
identify the standards and practices for all appropriate inquiries (AAI) under CERCLA § 101(35)(B). 
The purpose of the Phase I ESA was to identify, to the extent reasonably feasible, “recognized 
environmental conditions” (RECs). ASTM Practice E1527-13 defines RECs as: <br>…the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or petroleum products on a property 
under conditions that indicate an existing release, a past release, or a material threat of a release of 
any hazardous substances or petroleum products into structures on the property or into the ground, 
groundwater, or surface water of the property. <br><br>RECs include the presence of hazardous substances or petroleum products even under conditions 
that comply with applicable environmental laws. The term is not intended to include de minimis 
conditions that generally do not present a material risk of harm to public health or the environment, 
and that generally would not be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to the attention of 
appropriate governmental agencies. <br><br>1.2 Scope of Work <br><br>The scope of work included four components, each of which is briefly described below. <br><br>1.2.1 Site Reconnaissance Visit <br><br>On May 15, 2015, Ms. Caitlin Borbely and Mr. Erik Naylor of MFA conducted a site reconnaissance 
of the Property to look for evidence of RECs. The results of this site visit are documented in 
Section 2. <br><br>1.2.2 Records Review <br><br>MFA reviewed the following records: <br><br>R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br>• State and federal agency database records as described in Section 4.1. 
• Aerial photographs of the Property as described in Section 4.3.1. 
• Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps (SFIMs) for the Property, if available. See Section 4.3.2. 
• Historical city directories for the Property, if available. See Section 4.3.3. 
• Prior site assessment reports for the Property, if available. See Section 4.4. <br><br>The U.S. Geological Survey 7.5-minute quadrangle map (1990) for St. Helens, Oregon, was used as 
the physical setting source. <br><br>1.2.3  Interviews <br><br>To obtain site-specific information regarding the Property, MFA interviewed current and/or former 
managers, owners, occupants, and operators of the Property and adjoining properties as deemed 
prudent. MFA also interviewed state and/or local government officials for information about the 
Property. The interviews are discussed in detail in Section 5 of this report. <br><br>1.2.4 Report Preparations <br><br>MFA prepared this report in accordance with ASTM E1527-13. The recommended format was 
adjusted to improve reader usability and comprehension. Consistent with this ASTM guidance 
document, the following issues were not evaluated during the Phase I ESA: asbestos-containing 
building materials; radon; lead-based paint; lead in drinking water; wetlands; regulatory compliance; 
cultural and historic resources; industrial hygiene; health and safety; ecological resources; endangered 
species; indoor air quality (including vapor intrusion); biological agents; toxic fungus; mold; and 
high-voltage power lines. <br>1.3 Significant Assumptions <br><br>Significant assumptions include any assumptions made during the Phase I ESA process that have 
the potential to impact the opinions put forth in the report. No significant assumptions were made 
in the preparation of this report. <br><br>1.4 Limitations and Exceptions <br><br>Any opinions and/or recommendations presented in this Phase I ESA report apply to conditions 
that existed at the Property when the services were performed. No environmental assessment can 
wholly eliminate uncertainty regarding the potential for RECs in connection with a property. 
Performance of a Phase I ESA is intended to reduce, but not eliminate, uncertainty regarding the 
existence of RECs in connection with a property. <br><br>MFA conducted AAI regarding the potential for RECs at the Property. ASTM E1527-13 defines 
AAI as <br><br>…inquiry constituting “all appropriate inquiry into the previous ownership and uses of the property 
consistent with good commercial or customary practice” as defined in CERCLA, 42 U.S.C <br><br>R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br><br>PAGE**2**<br>§9601(35)(B), that will qualify a party to a commercial real estate transaction for one of threshold 
criteria for satisfying the LLPs to CERCLA liability (42 U.S.C §9601(35)(A) & (B), §9607(b)(3), 
§9607(q); and §9607(r)), assuming compliance with other elements of the defense. <br><br>MFA is not responsible for the impacts of any changes in environmental standards, practices, or 
regulations subsequent to performance of services, and does not warrant the accuracy of 
information supplied by others, or the use of segregated portions of this report. <br><br>This assessment does not include any near-shore or in-water leased areas, and thus potential 
environmental impacts in sediment were not evaluated. <br><br>1.5 Special Terms and Conditions <br><br>No special terms or conditions apply to this Phase I ESA other than those set forth in ASTM 
Standard E1527-13, CERCLA 101(35)B(iii), and 40 CFR Part 312. <br><br>1.6 Deviations <br><br>There were no deviations from ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13, CERCLA 101(35)B(iii), and 40 
CFR Part 312. <br>1.7 Additional Services <br><br>Other services in support of the potential purchase of the Property have been performed for the 
city, including review of historical documents and preparation of a contaminated-media management 
plan (CMMP) (MFA, 2015). Information gained from these tasks has been incorporated where 
applicable. <br><br>1.8 Qualifications of Responsible Environmental Professionals <br><br>The Phase I ESA of the Property was conducted by environmental professionals experienced in 
performing ESAs and familiar with ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 and industrial facility 
operations. Résumés of the environmental professionals involved in the performance of the Phase I 
ESA are included in Appendix A. <br><br>1.9 Reliance <br><br>For the purposes of the contractual relationship, the term “Client” refers to the City of St. Helens, 
which has sole permission to rely on this report. ASTM Standard Practice E1527-13 defines the 
“user” as the party seeking to use the standard to complete an ESA. The Client is the user of this 
Phase I ESA. <br>2.1 Objective and Methodology <br><br>Ms. Caitlin Borbely and Mr. Erik Naylor of MFA conducted a site reconnaissance visit on May 15, 
2015, in order to obtain information indicating the presence of RECs in connection with the 
Property. During the site reconnaissance visit, Ms. Borbely and Mr. Naylor visually and/or physically 
observed the Property for evidence of the presence of RECs, including evidence of underground 
storage tanks (USTs) and aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), petroleum products, transformers 
containing polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and use and storage of hazardous material. The 
interiors and exteriors of all structures were observed. The Property and adjacent properties were 
also observed from public thoroughfares. Site photographs taken during the site reconnaissance are 
included in Appendix B. <br><br>2.1.1 Exterior <br><br>Ms. Borbely and Mr. Naylor visually and physically observed the periphery of the Property and the 
periphery of all structures on the Property. The uses of roads and paths, with no apparent outlet, on 
the Property were identified in an effort to determine whether these roads were likely to have been 
used as avenues for disposal of hazardous substances or petroleum products. The Property and 
adjacent properties were also observed from public thoroughfares. <br>2.1.2  Interior <br><br>The Property contains no structures and thus interior spaces were not observed. <br><br>2.1.3 Limiting Conditions <br><br>Access limitations were not encountered during the site visit. <br><br>2.2 General Site Setting <br><br>2.2.1 Property Location and Legal Description <br><br>The Property encompasses 23.5 acres located at the southern end of 1st Street in St. Helens, 
Oregon, in the southeast quarter of the northwest quarter of section 3, township 4 north, range 1 
west of the Willamette Meridian (see Figure 1). The property is located in Columbia County and 
includes tax lots 4N1W 300 100, 4N1W 3BD 1100, and 4N1W3BD 1200. The property is located 
between a steep basalt cliff on the west and the Multnomah Channel of the Willamette River on the 
east at its confluence with the Columbia River. Contained within Tax Lot 100, and also included in 
the Property, is a strip of land currently dedicated as a railroad right-of-way and owned by the 
Oregon Department of Transportation (Figure 2). <br><br>R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br><br>PAGE**4**<br>2.2.2 Site and Vicinity Characteristics <br><br>The Property is currently zoned “heavy industrial.” The Property is currently vacant and contains no 
structures. The southern portion of the Property is paved, mostly with asphalt, although some 
remaining concrete building footprints were also observed. The northern portion of the Property is 
not paved, although some areas contain gravel. A fence restricts access from all but the eastern side 
of the Property which is bordered by the Multnomah Channel, and the southwestern portion of the 
Property which is bordered by a basalt cliff. In general, the Property is level. The Property is owned 
by Boise Cascade Wood Products LLC (Boise). <br><br>2.2.3 Current Uses of Property <br><br>The Property is currently vacant. <br><br>2.2.4 Past Uses of Property <br><br>Historical maps show that a sawmill occupied the Property in 1911, but it is believed that sawmills 
operated on the Property as early as the mid-1800s (Boise and ERM-West, 2015). Boise Cascade Wood 
Products LLC purchased the property in 1971 and subsequently converted the warehouse and 
planer mill in the southern portion of the property into a veneer mill. The sawmill was closed in 
1978 and was intentionally demolished through a controlled burn in 1985. The veneer mill remained 
in operation until 2009. Equipment was removed from the veneer mill in 2012, and the building was 
demolished in 2013. Wood treating (anti-sapstain) is not known to have been conducted on the 
Property. <br>2.2.5 Current Uses of Adjoining Properties <br><br>The Property is bordered by the following: <br><br>• North—St. Helen’s downtown and marina. <br><br>• South—Frogmore Slough, St. Helens wastewater treatment plant, and beyond that <br><br>Cascade Tissue facility and former site of the St. Helens Pulp and Paper Mill. <br><br>• East—Multnomah Channel and the Columbia River <br><br>• West—A basalt cliff and beyond that residential neighborhoods. Also, a portion of St. <br><br>Helens downtown borders the northwestern portion of the Property. <br><br>2.2.6 Past Uses of Adjoining Properties <br><br>In general, the past uses of adjoining properties were similar to the current use: residential and 
commercial as well as the southwest adjacent City of St. Helens wastewater treatment lagoon. <br>2.2.7 Current or Past Uses in Surrounding Area <br><br>As noted above, current and past uses of much of the surrounding area are residential and 
commercial, with a few notable exceptions. Of note is that the Cascade Tissue facility (former St. 
Helens Pulp and Paper Mill) is located approximately 2,000 feet to the south/southwest and 
upgradient along the Multnomah Channel. A number of other current/former industrial properties 
are located upgradient along Scappoose Bay. <br><br>2.2.8 Geologic, Hydrogeologic, Hydrologic, and Topographic <br><br>Conditions <br><br>In general, the Property and surrounding area are fairly level, with slightly lower gradients to the 
south and larger gradients to the east toward the Multnomah Channel and Columbia River. The 
southwest portion of the Property contains a basalt cliff. In its Geocheck report, Environmental 
Data Resources, Inc. (EDR) indicated that the soils on the Property are a silty clay loam to 29 inches 
below ground surface (bgs), followed by a silt loam to 59 inches bgs. According to a number of 
environmental reports, portions of the Property have been filled, some with dredged sediment, and 
thus sand, gravel, and concrete rubble fill reportedly have been observed up to 20 feet bgs. The 
Property is underlain by a dense basalt of the Columbia River Basalt Group, with a depth to 
groundwater ranging from approximately 10 to 19 feet bgs with the potential for perched 
groundwater and more shallow depths. <br>2.3 Interior and Exterior Observations <br><br>**Observed on the**

this report. <br><br>3.1 Title Records <br><br>A preliminary title report was provided by Boise from Ticor Title Company and was reviewed. 
Environmental liens or activity and use limitations were not observed to be noted within the 
provided title records. Section 3.2 discusses some activity use limitations that are currently recorded 
against the Property. The title records have been provided in Appendix C. <br><br>3.2 Environmental Liens or Activity and Use Limitations <br><br>The Property is subject to the conditions outlined in the June 8, 2015, Oregon Department of 
Environmental Quality (DEQ) conditional No Further Action (NFA) determination, including the 
following: <br><br>1. Extraction of groundwater through wells or by other means for use at the Property for <br><br>consumption or other beneficial use is prohibited. <br><br>2. An impermeable cap will be maintained in the lathe area to prevent potential future exposure 
by site workers or residents and to minimize future leaching of contamination into shallow 
groundwater. <br><br>3. Any contaminated soil or groundwater removed from the site must be managed in 
accordance with a DEQ-approved CMMP. Residual soil in the northern removal area, lathe 
area, and localized area around TP-13, and groundwater near B-18 and B-20, will be 
identified in the CMMP as specific areas of concern. These restrictions and requirements 
should be memorialized in an Easement and Equitable Servitudes recorded on the Property

0 <br><br>Based on MFA’s review of the report provided by EDR, the Property is listed in a number of 
regulatory databases, including Landfills, OR SPILLS, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination 
System, UST, LUST, VCS, and ECSI. The Property has been the subject of many investigations, as 
discussed further in Section 4.4, and contains controlled RECs (CRECs) as noted in Section 6.3. 
Further information as to the current status of the Property in the VCS and ECSI databases is 
discussed in Section 4.2 below. The Landfills database listings appears to be erroneous and likely are 
associated with the Cascade Tissue facility (owned by Boise White Paper) at 1300 Kaster Road in St. 
Helens. <br><br>The remaining sites have no reported releases, have reported that cleanup is complete and/or have 
received NFA determinations from DEQ, and/or have little potential to impact the Property, based <br><br>R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br>on their proximity and/or elevation in relation to the Property. This assessment does not include 
any near-shore or in-water leased areas, and thus potential environmental impacts to sediment from 
nearby sites were not evaluated. <br><br>4.2 Regulatory File Review <br><br>The file review portion of this Phase I ESA consisted of the following: an in-person review of the 
DEQ files for the Property was conducted in 2013, an interview with DEQ personnel and a review 
of online information provided by DEQ for nearby sites was conducted in June 2015, and a review 
of the regulatory documentation provided by Boise was completed. <br><br>A major milestone in the regulatory history of the Property includes the issuance of a conditional 
NFA determination for the Property on June 8, 2015. To ensure protectiveness, the conditions 
detailed in the NFA outline the control of environmental conditions on the Property and were 
developed in consideration of future redevelopment for a variety of uses, including residential. <br><br>4.3 Historical Use Information on Property and Adjoining Properties <br><br>MFA used the following information sources to obtain historical use(s) information. <br><br>4.3.1 Historical Aerial Photographs Review <br><br>Aerial photographs of the Property from 1951, 1960, 1970, 1977, 1981, 1990, 2000, 2005, 2006, 
2009, 2011, and 2012 were obtained from EDR and reviewed to identify historical changes to the 
Property and the Property’s historical uses, if any (see Appendix E). <br>1951—The Property during the 1950s, as depicted in these images, was an active lumber mill owned 
by Pope & Talbot. The Property contained storage areas and structures reflective of this use, such as 
sawmills, planer mills, stackers, dry kilns, lumber sheds, and a machine shop. An approximately 
1,000-foot-long cargo dock is visible along the northeastern edge of the Property. What appears to 
be a sandbar is located in the Multnomah channel off of the southern portion of the Property in the 
1951 image but is no longer visible in the 1960 image. The downtown portion of the City of St. 
Helens is visible north adjacent to the Property. Scattered residences are also visible in the area, with 
a higher density of residential development north of the downtown area. The area to the southwest 
of the Property appears largely undeveloped. <br><br>1960—The northern portion of the Property appears largely unchanged. The southern portion of 
the Property appears to have been cleared and potentially filled/graded with a new structure now 
visible in this area. According to historical maps of the Property provided by Boise, the uses of this 
structure included the crane shed and the planer. The surrounding area to the west of the Property 
has been developed more densely with residences. <br>1970—The lumber shed structure has been added on to the crane shed and the dry planer. The 
cargo dock appears to have been removed. The upstream portion of Frogmore Slough (south 
adjacent to the Property) has been filled. The surrounding area has increased in development 
density—largely of residential and commercial uses. 
R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br><br>PAGE**11**<br>1977—The quality of this image is poor. It appears that the Property remains largely unchanged. 
The city wastewater treatment lagoon has been constructed south of the Property. <br><br>1981—Structures have been removed on the northern portion of the Property. The sawmill building 
remains on the central portion of the Property, although it has been modified (removal of the 
former green sorter). The former lumber shed portion of the facility has been modified and is now 
longer. This structure is noted in documentation for the Property to have been converted by Boise 
to the former veneer production plant. The surrounding area appears largely unchanged. <br><br>1990—The quality of this image is poor. The sawmill and stacker building (also formerly near the 
central portion of the Property) are no longer visible. The rest of the Property as well as the 
surrounding area appear largely unchanged. <br><br>2000—The Property now appears to contain only the main facility structure(s) on the southern 
portion, with some storage areas throughout the yard. The surrounding area has increased in 
development density—largely of residential and commercial uses. <br><br>2005, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2012—The Property and surrounding area appear largely unchanged. <br>4.3.2 Sanborn Map Review <br><br>SFIMs were requested from EDR. SFIMS from 1921, 1939, 1948, and 1957 were reviewed to 
identify historical changes to the Property and the Property’s historical uses, if any (see Appendix F). <br><br>1921—Development on the northern portion of the Property was noted as the St. Helens Lumber 
Company’s Saw Mill, with features such as the sawmill, lumber shed, machine shop, and refuge 
burner. A note on the central/eastern half of the Property notes “Filled Land” “Covered with 
Slabwood Piles.” Another notation of filled land is slightly more inland, near the former railroad 
spur. The southern portion of the Property is depicted with small structures labeled “shacks” and a 
“sand dryer.” The portion of the depicted surrounding area shows low-density residential dwellings. <br><br>1939—The Property is noted to contain the Pope & Talbot Lumber Company, with features 
depicted such as the sorting table, tractor garage, machine shop, power house, forge, sawmill, and 
re-saw mill, as well as lumber sheds. A portion of the mill is noted to have been built on pilings and 
is “open under.” The southern area, approximately one third of the Property, is not depicted. <br>1948—The Property and surrounding area appear to remain largely unchanged. <br><br>1957—The Property and surrounding area appear to remain largely unchanged. <br><br>4.3.3 City Directories <br><br>EDR provided city directories for 1992, 1995, 1999, 2003, 2008, and 2013 (see Appendix G). The 
Property does not appear to be listed in these city directories. These directories confirm the use of 
adjoining and nearby properties as residential, commercial, and municipal. <br>4.4 Prior Environmental Reports for Property <br><br>Appendix H includes the documents that were provided by Boise as well as documentation obtained 
from DEQ (on-line and in-person file reviews). Specific documents pertaining to the environmental 
status of the upland portions of the Property were reviewed in the preparation of this report and 
have been referenced throughout as applicable. Much of the information below was provided or 
referenced in the 2015 Site Investigation and Remediation Report (Boise and ERM-West, Inc.), as it 
summarized prior investigations/data in light of current conditions. <br><br>The following is a list of the site investigations and remedial actions that have been noted to have 
taken place at the Property: <br><br>• UST removal and confirmation sampling in 1987 
• Maintenance shop soil-removal actions in 1995 and 1997 
• Lathe area soil-removal action in 2001 
• Remediation investigation/feasibility study in 2002 through 2004 
• Phase I ESA in 2004 
• Concrete-vault removal in 2005 
• Stormwater drain and sump cleanout in 2013 
• Soil and groundwater investigation in 2013 through 2014 
• Soil-removal action for shallow metals in 2014 <br>Below is a summary of environmental conditions and prior investigation findings for the Property 
based on a review of the above documents. This summary references certain areas on the Property 
(named for the former use of the area), including the Lathe Area, Oil House and Transformer Area, 
Barker Area, Maintenance Shop and UST Area, Sorter/Stacker Area, Sawmill Area, and Riverside 
(see Figure 5). The future use of the Property is currently unknown. Where sample data were 
available for review, they have been compared to the DEQ risk-based concentrations (RBCs) for 
residential, urban residential, occupational, and construction and excavation workers (as applicable). 
The preliminary risk assessment prepared by Boise and ERM, and approved by ODEQ, noted that 
exposure of ecological receptors to shallow soil contamination was considered unlikely due to 
projected future use of the Property. Additional, potentially more stringent screening criteria may be 
applicable to the Property (i.e., criteria for the protection of surface water receptors). <br><br>FORMER SAWMILL AREA <br><br>During the 2013/2014 investigation, the locations of 23 test pits were randomly selected throughout 
the Property. A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), benzo(a)pyrene, above the DEQ 
residential, urban residential, and occupational RBCs was observed in soil on the north-central 
portion of the Property, in the former Sawmill Area. Two other PAHs, benzo(b)fluoranthene and 
dibenzo(a,h)anthracene, were also observed at this location, at concentrations above the DEQ 
residential and urban residential RBCs in soil. As these concentrations were not observed in nearby 
test pits, these impacts appears to be of a limited extent. <br>Lead-impacted soil along a portion of the northwestern periphery of the Property was also observed 
in samples collected from test pits. Approximately 1,708 tons of impacted soil was excavated from 
this area and disposed of off site. The target cleanup levels used during this removal action were 400 
parts per million (ppm) for soil up to 3 feet bgs and 800 ppm for soil at depths greater than 3 feet. A 
description of the confirmation samples and sample results includes a thin layer of residual soil on 
bedrock in the deepest part of the excavation (approximately 5-10 feet bgs), with concentrations 
remaining above target cleanup levels. Additionally, residual lead levels above RBCs for both 
residential and construction/excavation workers are present in samples along the northern sidewall 
of the excavation within about 3 feet of the property boundary. Impacted soil near the property 
boundary could not be removed due to concerns about damaging the adjacent building to the north, 
or property to the west which is at a higher elevation. The strip of remaining soil in this area has 
been identified in the CMMP as a restricted area, prompting appropriate sampling of and handling 
procedures for soil in this area upon redevelopment of the Property. As the Property is currently 
vacant and fenced, this strip of lead-impacted soil has been identified as a CREC. <br>In 1987 a 2,000-gallon and a 3,000-gallon UST, concrete pad, and associated piping and 
contaminated soils were removed (approximately 60 to 80 cubic yards of material) from the 
northern portion of the Property. These tanks were noted in the remedial investigation report to 
have formerly contained gasoline and diesel. One confirmation soil sample and two pit water 
samples were collected and sampled for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (BTEX) at the 
time of removal. There were no detections in soil but reportedly there were exceedances of BTEX 
above federal standards in pit water. Followup investigations of this area were conducted in 2003 
and 2014. The 2003 investigation identified residual-range organics (RRO) in soil below applicable 
RBCs, and PAHs (phenanthrene and fluorene) noted to be above ecological screening levels in 
groundwater 
identified PAHs 
(benzo(a)pyrene, benzo(b)fluoranthene, and naphthalene) and diesel-range organics (DRO) and 
gasoline- and oil-range hydrocarbons in groundwater above DEQ residential, urban residential, and 
occupational RBCs (MFA, 2014). <br><br>(Boise and ERM-West, 2015). The 2014  investigation <br>FORMER LATHE AREA <br><br>During repair of the lathe in 2001, petroleum-impacted soil was discovered beneath the floor, and 
approximately 10 cubic yards was removed and disposed of off site. As impacts are currently located 
under the former building concrete floor/foundation, no additional removal has been conducted. 
This area was investigated in 2002/2003 and again in 2013/2014. Both of these investigations have 
helped delineate the area of impacts and the range of constituents present in soil and groundwater. 
The lathe area is impacted by DRO and RRO in soil above DEQ residential, urban residential, and 
occupational and construction worker RBCs. Soil samples from 19 feet bgs were observed to 
contain one or more PAHs above the DEQ residential and urban residential RBCs, although as this 
soil is deeper than 3 feet bgs, these RBCs are not applicable unless the soil is brought to the surface. 
Groundwater impacts are discussed in the groundwater section below. The area to be delineated in <br><br>R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br>the forthcoming Easement and Equitable Servitudes in relation to impacted soil from the former 
lathe is depicted on Figures 3 and 4. <br><br>FORMER OIL HOUSE AND TRANSFORMER AREA <br><br>A few detections of DRO and RRO (both assessed with the generic DEQ RBC for diesel) have 
been observed in the area of the former Oil House and Transformer Area. PCBs have not been 
detected in samples from this area. One soil sample from 19 feet bgs was observed to contain RRO 
at 14,600 ppm, which is above the DEQ residential, urban residential, and occupational and 
construction worker RBCs, although as this soil is deeper than 3 feet bgs, these RBCs are not 
applicable unless the soil is brought to the surface. Five PAHs in excess of the DEQ residential and 
urban residential RBCs have been observed in soil from this area. <br><br>FORMER LOG DEBARKER AREA <br><br>One soil sample from 19 feet bgs was observed to contain one or more PAHs above the DEQ 
residential, urban residential, and occupational worker RBCs, although as this soil is deeper than 3 
feet bgs, these RBCs are not applicable unless the soil is brought to the surface. Only the excavation 
worker RBC is often applicable to soils deeper than 3 feet bgs. A number of DRO and RRO 
detections were also observed in soil from this area, although they were detected at concentrations 
below applicable RBCs. <br>CONCRETE VAULT <br><br>A buried concrete vault was discovered during removal of the sorter/stacker building in 2005. The 
vault contained hydraulic oil and water and was pumped out with oversight by an environmental 
consultant. The vault was noted to be in good condition, with no indication of a release of hydraulic 
oil. This area was investigated in 2002/2003 (in conjunction with the lumber sorter hydraulic lift), 
with no impacts observed. <br><br>STORMWATER <br><br>The Property contains four stormwater outfalls that discharge to the adjacent Multnomah Channel 
or the Frogmore Slough. Discharge from three of these outfalls was sampled in 2013/2014. The 
fourth outfall was not sampled, as it was reported to have formerly drained only roof runoff and the 
buildings were demolished in 2013. The samples were analyzed for PCBs, PAHs, and metals 
(arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury), and it was noted that all constituents were below their 
respective DEQ surface water ecological screening level values (Boise and ERM-West, 2015). <br><br>GROUNDWATER <br><br>Groundwater data collected in 2002/2003 and 2013/2014 (including data collected by MFA in 2013) 
show DEQ RBC exceedances as follows: <br>• Arsenic—residential, urban residential, and occupational RBC exceedances 
groundwater were observed in all assessed locations (the Lathe Area and Riverside). <br><br>in <br><br>R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br><br>PAGE**15**<br>• Lead—residential, urban residential, and occupational RBC exceedances in groundwater, 
in three of four locations assessed in the Lathe Area. The only other area assessed for 
lead in groundwater was Riverside; lead was not detected above RBCs in these samples. <br><br>• PAHs (multiple)—residential, urban residential, and occupational RBC exceedances in 
groundwater were observed in the following assessed areas: the Lathe Area, the Oil 
House and Transformer Area, the Barker Area, Riverside, and the Maintenance Shop 
and UST Area. PAHs were not observed in samples collected from the Sorter/Stacker 
Area. Benzo(a)pyrene was observed to exceed the DEQ excavation worker RBC in two 
locations, one in the Riverside Area and one in the Barker Area. <br><br>• DRO/RRO—residential, urban residential, and occupational RBC exceedances in 
groundwater were observed in the following assessed areas: the Lathe Area, the Oil 
House and Transformer Area, the Barker Area, and Riverside. Residential and urban 
residential RBC exceedances were observed in the Maintenance Shop and UST Area. 
DRO and RRO were not observed in samples collected from the Sorter/Stacker Area. 
Both the DRO and the RRO were assessed with the generic DEQ RBC for diesel. <br>5.1 Interview(s) with Representative(s) of Owner <br><br>Ms. Merideth D’Andrea of MFA was directed to Mr. Russell Strader, representative for the current 
Property owner, for general and site-specific information regarding the Property. Mr. Strader 
indicated that, to his knowledge, there were no pending, threatened, or past litigation or 
administrative proceedings relevant to hazardous substances or petroleum products on the Property. 
He was not aware of any notices from any government agency regarding any possible violation of 
environmental laws or possible liability relating to hazardous substances or petroleum products 
relative to the Property. According to Mr. Strader, there are no environmental liens on the Property. <br><br>Additionally, Mr. Strader noted that the Property has access to municipal water and sewer and that 
septic systems are not present on the Property. In regard to wells, Mr. Strader noted that there are 
no production wells on the Property and that 14 monitoring wells have been decommissioned. <br><br>5.2 Interview with Key Site Manager <br><br>See Section 5.1. <br><br>5.3 Interview with Occupant <br><br>The Property is currently vacant. <br>5.4 Interview with Previous Operator, Owner, and Occupant <br><br>Contact information for previous operators, owners, and occupants was not provided and/or is not 
likely to be relevant to this assessment. <br><br>5.5 Interview(s) with State and/or Local Government Officials <br><br>Ms. Merideth D’Andrea of MFA interviewed Mr. Mark Pugh of DEQ for information regarding the 
Property and surrounding area. Mr. Pugh is the DEQ project manager for the Property. Mr. Pugh 
acknowledged the recent NFA and the forthcoming PPA and Consent Judgment and reiterated that 
the Property contains fill material. Ms. D’Andrea inquired as to Mr. Pugh’s knowledge of the 
surrounding area and other sites that may have the potential to impact the Property. Mr. Pugh did 
not identify any nearby sites although he did note the ongoing Scappoose Bay sediment 
investigations. <br><br>5.6 Interview with Owners or Occupants of Adjoining or Nearby <br><br>Properties <br><br>Interviews with owners or occupants of nearby properties are required for properties that have been 
abandoned and that have evidence of potential unauthorized uses or evidence of uncontrolled 
access. Adjoining properties do not fit this description; therefore, interviews of these neighbors were 
not conducted. <br>6.1 Recognized Environmental Conditions <br><br>ASTM E1527-13 defines RECs as the presence or likely presence of any hazardous substances or 
petroleum products in, on, or at a property: (1) due to any release to the environment; (2) under 
conditions indicative of a release to the environment; or (3) under conditions that pose a material 
threat of a future release to the environment. <br><br>No uncontrolled RECs were identified for the Property. <br><br>6.2 Historical Recognized Environmental Conditions <br><br>ASTM E1527-13 defines historical RECs (HRECs) as a past release of any hazardous substances or 
petroleum products that has occurred in connection with the Property and that has been addressed 
to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority, or meets unrestricted use criteria established 
by a regulatory authority, without the Property being subjected to any required controls. <br><br>One HREC was identified for the Property as follows: <br><br>R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br><br>PAGE**17**<br>A former maintenance building on the northwestern corner of the Property was demolished in the 
mid-1990s, and petroleum-impacted soil was observed under the concrete floor. Approximately 
400 tons of soil was excavated and disposed of at an off-site facility. Post-excavation confirmation 
soil sampling depicts low concentrations of volatile organic compounds and PAHs. Additional soil 
sampling was conducted in 2002/2003, with detections of PAHs below all applicable human health 
RBCs. <br><br>6.3 Controlled Recognized Environmental Conditions <br><br>ASTM E1527-13 defines CRECs as resulting from a past release of hazardous substances or 
petroleum products that has been addressed to the satisfaction of the applicable regulatory authority. <br><br>The CRECs identified through completion of this Phase I ESA are noted below and are discussed in 
further detail throughout this report. Figure 5 displays the area names used to describe different 
portions of the Property. <br><br>• Groundwater concentration in excess of the DEQ residential, urban residential, and 
occupational RBCs for lead, arsenic, PAHs, DRO, and RRO have been observed on 
portions of the Property. In addition, benzo(a)pyrene (a PAH) was observed in 
groundwater in excess of the DEQ excavation worker RBC in two locations on the 
southeastern portion of the Property (one in Riverside and one in the Barker Area). <br><br>• PAHs in shallow soil above the DEQ residential, urban residential, and occupational <br><br>RBCs in the Lumber Mill Area. <br>• DRO and RRO impacts to shallow and deep soil above DEQ residential, urban 
residential, and occupational and construction worker RBCs was observed in the Lathe 
Area. <br><br>• Lead-impacted soil remains along a portion of the northwestern periphery of the <br><br>Property. <br><br>• <br><br>It is recognized that, because of the known presence of fill material and long operational 
history of the Property, additional areas that have not been identified may contain 
impacted soil and/or groundwater. For example, sampling of soils at depths less than 
3 feet bgs is limited. There are also a number of instances where soils at depth would 
exceed residential, urban residential, and occupational and/or construction worker RBCs 
if brought to the surface (i.e., the Lathe Area, the Oil House and Transformer Area, the 
Barker Area, and Riverside). <br><br>On June 8, 2015, DEQ issued a conditional NFA determination for the Property. To ensure 
protectiveness, the conditions detailed in the NFA outline the control of environmental conditions 
on the Property and were developed in consideration of future redevelopment for a variety of uses, 
including residential. All of the above-noted CRECs are controlled through the conditions outlined 
in the DEQ NFA determination, including the following: <br>1.Extraction of groundwater through wells or by other means for use at the Property for<br><br>consumption or other beneficial use is prohibited.<br><br>2.An impermeable cap will be maintained in the lathe area to prevent potential future exposure
by site workers or residents and to minimize future leaching of contamination into shallow
groundwater.<br><br>3.Any contaminated soil or groundwater removed from the site must be managed in
accordance with a DEQ-approved CMMP. Residual soil in the northern removal area, lathe
area, and localized area around TP-13,2 and groundwater near B-18 and B-20,3 will be
identified in the CMMP as specific areas of concern. These restrictions and requirements
should be memorialized in an Easement and Equitable Servitudes recorded on the Property
deed.<br><br>6.4 De Minimis Conditions <br><br>No de minimis conditions were identified on the Property. <br><br>6.5 Additional Findings <br><br>A state-led sediment investigation is being conducted along the Multnomah Channel (adjacent to the 
Property) and the Scappoose Slough. A number of the investigations discussed throughout this 
report have focused on assessing the Property’s potential to be a contributing upland source area. 
These investigations have documented current conditions, and many include work plans accepted by 
DEQ. As with any ongoing investigation, there remains the potential for the Property to be 
identified as a contributing upland source area in the future, either under observance of additional 
data and/or because of changing conditions. <br>6.6 Data Gaps <br><br>No significant data gaps were identified. <br><br>6.7 Activity Use Limitations Compliance <br><br>The Property is subject to the conditions noted in Section 6.3 above as identified in the DEQ 
conditional No Further Action determination. It is assumed that these conditions will soon be 
memorialized through other channels in the near future—for example, through a deed restriction. <br><br>6.8 Statement of Environmental Professionals Conducting Phase I <br><br>Environmental Site Assessment <br><br>BOISE VENEER <br>2 TP-13 is located in the Sawmill Area of the Property.

CONFIDENTIAL <br>*The material and data in this report were prepared under the supervision and direction of the undersigned.*
MAUL FOSTER & ALONGI, INC. <br><br>*Caitlin Borbely*
*Environmental Scientist*<br><br>*Merideth D’Andrea, RG, LG*
*Senior Geologist*<br>We declare that, to the best of our professional knowledge and belief, we meet the definition of 
environmental professional as defined in §312.10 of 40 CFR 312 and 12.13.2. We have the specific 
qualifications based on education, training, and experience to assess a property of the nature, history, 
and setting of the subject property. We have developed and performed all appropriate inquiries in 
conformance with the standards and practices set forth in 40 CFR Part 312. <br>7 CONCLUSIONS<br><br>MFA has conducted a Phase I ESA, in conformance with the scope and limitations of ASTM 
Practice E1527-13, of 400 South 1st Street, St. Helens, Oregon, the Property. Any exceptions to, or 
deviations from, this practice are described in Section 1 of this report. <br><br>The Phase I ESA revealed evidence of CRECs in connection with the Property: <br><br>•Groundwater concentrations in excess of the DEQ RBCs for lead, arsenic, PAHs, DRO,<br><br>and RRO have been observed on portions of the Property.<br><br>•PAHs in shallow soil above the DEQ RBCs in the Lumber Mill Area.<br><br>•DRO and RRO impacts to shallow and deep soil above DEQ RBCs were observed in<br><br>the Lathe Area.<br><br>R:\0830.01 City of St. Helens\Report\01_2015.06.29 Phase I ESA\Rf_Boise Veneer Phase I ESA.docx 
CONFIDENTIAL <br><br>PAGE**20**<br>•Lead-impacted soil remains along a portion of the northwestern periphery of the<br><br>Property.<br><br>•<br><br>It is recognized that, because of the known presence of fill material and long operational
history of the Property, that additional areas that have not been identified may contain
impacted soil and/or groundwater.<br><br>All of the above-noted CRECs are controlled through the conditions outlined in the DEQ NFA 
determination. <br>8 REFERENCES<br><br>Boise and ERM-West. 2015. Site investigation and remediation report for Boise Cascade St. Helens,

accepted professional consulting principles and practices. No other warranty, express or implied, is 
made. These services were performed consistent with our agreement with our Client. This report is 
solely for the use and information of our Client unless otherwise noted. Any reliance on this report 
by a third party is at such party’s sole risk. <br><br>Opinions and recommendations contained in this report apply to conditions existing when services 
were performed and are intended only for the Client, purposes, locations, time frames, and project 
parameters indicated. We are not responsible for the impacts of any changes in environmental 
standards, practices, or regulations subsequent to performance of services. We do not warrant the 
accuracy of information supplied by others, or the use of segregated portions of this report. <br><br>The purpose of an environmental assessment is to reasonably evaluate the potential for or actual 
impact of past practices on a given site area. In performing an environmental assessment, it is 
understood that a balance must be struck between a reasonable inquiry into the environmental issues 
and an exhaustive analysis of each conceivable issue of potential concern. The following paragraphs 
discuss the assumptions and parameters under which such an opinion is rendered.

CONFIDENTIAL <br><br>PAGE**21**<br>No investigation is thorough enough to exclude the presence of hazardous materials at a given site. 
If hazardous conditions have not been identified during the assessment, such a finding should not, 
therefore, be construed as a guarantee of the absence of such materials on the site, but rather as the 
result of the services performed within the scope, limitations, and cost of the work performed. <br><br>Environmental conditions that cannot be identified by visual observation may exist at the site. 
Where subsurface work was performed, our professional opinions are based in part on 
interpretation of data from discrete sampling locations that may not represent actual conditions at 
unsampled locations. <br><br>Except where there is express concern of our Client, or where specific environmental contaminants 
have been previously reported by others, naturally occurring toxic substances, potential 
environmental contaminants inside buildings, or contaminant concentrations that are not of current 
environmental concern may not be reflected in this document. <br>d
